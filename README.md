# "React" Assignment

## Part I

Create a learning resource that gives the user feedback â€“ in other words, responds to the user's input/actions. Actions could include:

* Clicking
* Typing
* Scrolling

or lack of any of those things. Feel free to pick a new subject, or dive deeper with one you've already used.

### Examples

1. [Operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(game)), which uses sound to inform the player they are doing something wrong.

1. An essay helper, where the user needs the their entry in a [`<textarea>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) to have five paragraphs and be 300-500 words.
1. An essay helper which prompts the user to make sure they are still paying attention if they haven't written anything in a few minutes, but has the option to pause (for dinner, bathroom breaks, and The Voice).

## Part II

### UX Study

Do a mini user experience (UX) research study. While not a significant sample size, find (minimum) three people to test out your app. For starters,

* Don't tell them what the tutorial is supposed to teach.
* Write down as much as possible of their reactions.
    * Recording audio/video of the session is helpful so that you can revisit later, but make sure to get their consent.

Use these steps/questions as a framework:

1. Before
    1. Hide the screen/tab with the app on it
    1. Ask
        1. "Have you ever done a usability study before?"
            * Explain that they should speak their thoughts aloud throughout, and try to keep their thoughts unfiltered.s
        1. "What is your prior experience with [broad concept]?"
1. Show them the screen, without interacting with it
    * "What do you see?"
    * "What does this thing do?"
1. Have them play with it for a minute or so
    * Remind them to think aloud
1. After
    * "What did you learn from this?"
    * "What was difficult/confusing?"

Include their anonymized responses as "user stories" in the README, explaining what they responded to each question and then a conclusion of what you learned from them.

### Iterate

Take what you learned from your UX study, and iterate on your application. Include a description in the README of what changed.
